# Hello ! :coffee:

I'm a student who loves programming. I speak English and French, but I can also speak Spanish, Japanese and Chinese.
Looking for experiences to fill in my CV.
I am developer at @BotMarket as a back-end developer. Forthwith I am available for being hired for a paid freelance position.
